This is first line and I'm making the first change in this

I'm adding another line after committing and them removed the config and will try to commit again

Journey 1: (pre-condition: no user.email config)
1) Create Repo
2) Add to stage
3) Try to commit

Journey 2: (pre-condition: no user.email config)
1) Create Repo
2) Add to stage
3) config with user.email
4) Commit

Journey 3:
1) After first commit, unset the global config
2) Then make changes in the local > Add to stage > Try to commit

Journey 4:
1) How to link the local repo to a remote one to push?
