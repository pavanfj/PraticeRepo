This is first line and I'm making the first change in this

I'm adding another line after committing and them removed the config and will try to commit again

I've removed the email from the configuration and now trying to commit.

Journey 1: (pre-condition: no user.email config)
1) Create Repo
2) Add to stage
3) Try to commit

Journey 2: (pre-condition: no user.email config)
1) Create Repo
2) Add to stage
3) config with user.email
4) Commit

Journey 3:
1) After first commit, unset the global config
2) Then make changes in the local > Add to stage > Try to commit

Journey 4:
1) Try to commit with just local config, instead of global one.

Journey 5:
1) How to link the local repo to a remote one to push?
This has been successfully achieved.
