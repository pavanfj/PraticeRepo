This is first line and I'm making the first change in this

I'm adding another line after committing and them removed the config and will try to commit again

I've removed the email from the configuration and now trying to commit.

Journey 5:
1) How to link the local repo to a remote one to push?
This has been successfully achieved.

I've tried to remove the access with remote repo.

Removed the credentials from the credentials manager.

I want to just set the upstream only not push.

Completed all that, now doing Monday revision
After commit, let's try to set an upstream, with a remote repo and then try to remove that.

Now trying to unset the upstream.
