This is first line and I'm making the first change in this

I'm adding another line after committing and them removed the config and will try to commit again

I've removed the email from the configuration and now trying to commit.

Journey 5:
1) How to link the local repo to a remote one to push?
This has been successfully achieved.

I've tried to remove the access with remote repo.

Removed the credentials from the credentials manager.

I want to just set the upstream only not push.

Completed all that, now doing Monday revision
After commit, let's try to set an upstream, with a remote repo and then try to remove that.

Now trying to unset the upstream.

Tuesday practice:
I will first set upstream and try to push by removing the credentials.
 
Signed out from the browser and then trying to push the code an removed the details from the credentials manager as well.

Practice again
1) Commit in local repo
2) make connect and set upstream with remote repo
3) push and them remove all the connections.
4) make again the local repo independent of remote repo.
